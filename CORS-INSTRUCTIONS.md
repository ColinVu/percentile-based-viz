# CORS Fix Instructions

## The Problem
When opening `index.html` directly in a browser (using `file://` protocol), browsers block access to local Excel files due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) security policy.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Run a Local Server (Recommended)
This allows the app to load the actual Excel files:

**Python (if installed):**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Node.js (if installed):**
```bash
npx serve .
```

**PHP (if installed):**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:8000`

### Option 2: Use Fallback Sample Data
The app automatically provides representative sample data when the Excel files can't be loaded. This still demonstrates all functionality.

### Option 3: Upload Custom Files
The file upload feature works regardless of CORS restrictions, so you can still upload and analyze your own Excel files.

## What's Been Fixed
- Added fallback sample data for both US County and Country Development datasets
- Added user-friendly CORS information popup
- Maintained all original functionality
- File uploads still work for custom datasets

The application will work in all scenarios, with the best experience when running through a local server.
